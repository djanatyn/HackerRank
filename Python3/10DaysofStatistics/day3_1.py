#Conditional Probability
#-------------------------
# Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. 
# What is the probability that both children are boys?

#Set up
#-------------------------

#orders of children:
# BB
# BG
# GB
# GG

#probability:
# p(BB|child1=B) = 
# p(BB and one child is a B)/p(one is a B)

# p(one is a B) = 1
# p(BB and one is a B) = 1/3

# p(BB|one is a boy) = 1/3

p = 1/3
