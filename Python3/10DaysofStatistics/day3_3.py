#Drawing Marbles
# A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
# Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
# If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

# first draw (red marble):
# 3/7

# second draw (blue marble):
# 4/6 (this is the answer)


ANOTHER APPROACH:
# P(B2|R1) = P(R1 and B2) / P(R1)
# P(B2|R1) = (P(R1|B2) * P(B2)) / P(R1)
# P(B2|R1) = ((1/2) * (4/7)) / (3/7)
# P(B2|R1) = 2/3
