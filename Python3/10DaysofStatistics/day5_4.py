# Normal Distribution II

# The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students have a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. 
# If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percentage of the students:

# 1. Scored higher than 80 (i.e., have a grade > 80)?
# 2. Passed the test (i.e., have a grade >= 60)?
# 3. Failed the test (i.e., have a grade < 60)?
# Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, 
# rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

# continuous distribution or a function that can take on values anywhere on the real line
# The normal distribution is parameterized by two parameters: the mean of the distribution Î¼ and the variance Ïƒ2.
